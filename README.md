### Currently implemented
- Calculating the current direction and distance to the current destination.
- Moving in a straight line towards the current destination.
- Throttle that is adjusted according to the difference between current and desired speed.
- Progressive steering that turns the wheel more the bigger the difference is between the current and desired directions.
- Stopping at red lights.
- Following speed limits somewhat. The more powerful cars might go a few km/h over the limit with the current formula for calculating throttle, but perhaps that only makes the AI more human... ;)
